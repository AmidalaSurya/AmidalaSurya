## Hi there 👋

👋 Hi, I'm Amidala Surya Kumar

I'm a motivated and detail-oriented Full Stack Developer with hands-on experience in building scalable web applications. I have strong problem-solving skills and a solid foundation in Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures, and SDLC. I’m passionate about applying my technical knowledge to real-world projects and continuously improving my skills.

👨‍💻 About Me

I am skilled in Java, Python, JavaScript, React, and SQL, with experience in both frontend and backend development. I enjoy building complete applications—from designing responsive user interfaces to implementing secure backend APIs.

I have worked on projects involving JWT authentication, REST APIs, machine learning models, and data analysis, which strengthened my understanding of full-stack development and real-world system design. I focus on writing clean, maintainable code and following best practices.

I thrive in collaborative environments, adapt quickly to new technologies, and am eager to contribute as an entry-level software engineer in a growth-oriented organization.
